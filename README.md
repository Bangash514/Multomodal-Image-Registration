# Multomodal-Image-Registration
Multimodal Image Registration of Ultrasound and CT DICOM

It has been defined as; 
The process of aliging two or more images of diffeent modalities, such as Ultrasound and CT, or CT and MRI and so on. Multimodal is used in other areas such as remote sensing, computer vision and robotics.

Goal of Multimodal Image Registration:
The goal is to find a transformation that maps the pixel coordinates of one image onto the corresponding pixel coordinate of anothe image.

The Registration invoves some steps like; Feature extraction, feature matching, and transformation estimation.
